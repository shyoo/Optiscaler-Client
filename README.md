## 🚀 Key Features

### Game Discovery

- **Multi-Platform Auto-Scanner** — Scans **Steam, Epic Games, GOG, EA, Ubisoft, Battle.net, Heroic, and Xbox/Microsoft Store** libraries in parallel. On Linux, only **Steam** and **Heroic** (Epic Games, GOG) are scanned automatically.
- **Custom Folder Scanning** — Add any folder as a scan source for DRM-free or standalone games.
- **Manual Game Addition** — Add games by selecting the executable directly.
- **Drive Root Filtering** — Limit scanning to specific drives.
- **Smart Exclusions** — Pre-configured exclusions for non-game entries (e.g., Wallpaper Engine, Steamworks Redistributables).
- **Cover Art Fetching** — Automatically fetches game cover art from Steam API and SteamGridDB with local caching.

### Installation & Uninstallation

- **Quick Install / Uninstall** — One-click toggle per game directly from the main view. Automatically downloads components if not cached.
- **Auto Install** — Detects game directory structure automatically, including **UE5/Phoenix** game layouts.
- **Manual Install** — Select the target executable manually for non-standard game structures.
- **Bulk Install** — Install OptiScaler across multiple games at once with platform filtering, component selection, and profile application.
- **Injection Method Selection** — Choose the DLL injection method: `dxgi.dll`, `winmm.dll`, `d3d12.dll`, `dbghelp.dll`, `version.dll`, `wininet.dll`, `winhttp.dll`.
- **Backup & Restore** — Original game files are backed up before installation and restored on uninstall.

### Component Management

- **OptiScaler** — Core upscaling mod with stable, beta, and nightly version channels.
- **Fakenvapi** — Compatibility layer for **AMD/Intel GPUs**, installed alongside OptiScaler when needed.
- **Nukem's DLSSG-to-FSR3** — Frame generation bridge that converts DLSS Frame Gen to FSR3.
- **FSR 4 DLL (Swap)** — Switch between INT8 and FP8 FSR 4 builds, or just swap the game's FSR 4 files directly without installing OptiScaler. Supports importing custom FSR 4 DLL versions.
- **OptiPatcher** — ASI plugin loader, automatically configured with `LoadAsiPlugins=true` in OptiScaler.ini.
- **DLSS Enabler** — Optional Frame Generation / Multi Frame Generation support, downloaded from an unofficial mirror since official builds are Nexus Mods-only.

### Game Management Shortcuts

- **Output Upscaler Selector** — Override a game's upscaling technology (Default, FSR 2/3/4, XeSS, DLSS) directly from the Manage window, without opening Profiles.
- **Upscaling Quality Selector** — Override the upscaler's input resolution (Game controlled, Native AA, Ultra Quality, Quality, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance, or a custom scale factor) directly from the Manage window.
- **Frame Generation & Multi Frame Generation** — Pick a Frame Generation technology and multiplier (x3–x6 for DLSS-G output) with automatic path/nvngx/Streamline setup, or use Advanced Options for manual control. Includes DLSS Enabler support for Multi Frame Generation.
- **Spoofing Toggle** — Enable or disable vendor spoofing per game, with an Auto default.

### Experimental Features

Optional integrations, enabled from **Settings → Experimental**:

- **RenoDx Addons** — Automatically fetches the per-game RenoDx addon for use with ReShade.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements

### Platform Support

- Windows
- Linux

### Instructions

1. Download the latest release asset from [Releases](https://github.com/Optiscaler-Client/Optiscaler-Client/releases).
2. Extract the package.
3. Run `OptiscalerClient.exe`.

### Notes

- The app is self-contained, so no external .NET runtime installation is required.
- On Linux, automatic scanner sources are focused on Steam and Heroic libraries.
- Manual add/install flows currently target executable files (`.exe`) for game selection.
- **Arch Linux (AUR):** Available as [`optiscaler-client-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/optiscaler-client-bin), maintained by the community (`yay -S optiscaler-client-bin`). See [`packaging/aur/README.md`](packaging/aur/README.md) for details.

### 🔨 Building from Source

#### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

#### Clone & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Optiscaler-Client/Optiscaler-Client.git
cd Optiscaler-Client

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application (or run both together: dotnet build && dotnet run)
dotnet run
```

> **Note:** `dotnet run` automatically builds the project before starting if changes are detected, but running `dotnet build` beforehand is useful to verify compilation and catch errors without launching the UI.

#### Standalone Publishing (Single-File)

To generate self-contained, single-file binaries matching the official releases:

- **Windows (x64):**
  ```bash
  dotnet publish OptiscalerClient.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o dist/win-x64
  ```

- **Linux (x64):**
  ```bash
  dotnet publish OptiscalerClient.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o dist/linux-x64
  ```

- **Linux (ARM64):**
  ```bash
  dotnet publish OptiscalerClient.csproj -c Release -r linux-arm64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o dist/linux-arm64
  ```

- **Nix / NixOS:**
  ```bash
  nix flake update
  nix build .#default -L
  ```

## 🛡️ Security & Antivirus False Positives

**Is this software safe?**

Yes, OptiScaler Client is completely safe and open-source. However, some antivirus programs may flag it as suspicious due to **false positive detections**.

### Why does this happen?

- **File Downloads**: The app downloads `.zip` and `.dll` files from GitHub (OptiScaler, Fakenvapi, NukemFG)
- **Heuristic Detection**: Antivirus software may flag download behavior as "potentially unwanted"
- **Unsigned Binary**: The executable is not digitally signed (code signing certificates cost $100-300/year)

### Common False Positives

- **Zillya**: `Downloader.MLoki.Win64.10` — Known for aggressive heuristics
- **Other AVs**: May show generic "downloader" or "trojan" warnings

### What you can do

1. **Verify the Source**: Download only from official [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Optiscaler-Client/Optiscaler-Client/releases)
2. **Check VirusTotal**: Upload the file to [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com) — most reputable AVs will show clean
3. **Review the Code**: This is open-source — you can inspect all code before running
4. **Add Exception**: Whitelist `OptiscalerClient.exe` in your antivirus settings

### Transparency

All downloads are from official sources:
- OptiScaler: `github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler`
- Fakenvapi: `github.com/optiscaler/fakenvapi`
- NukemFG: `github.com/Nukem9/dlssg-to-fsr3`

The application **never** collects personal data, connects to third-party servers, or performs any malicious actions. All source code is available for audit.
